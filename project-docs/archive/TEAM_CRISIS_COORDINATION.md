# 🚨 TEAM CRISIS COORDINATION - MENTARA PROJECT

**Manager Agent**: Lead Crisis Coordinator  
**Date**: 2025-01-14  
**Status**: 🔴 CRITICAL - Platform Non-Functional  
**Issue**: Backend Authentication Crisis Blocking All Core Features

---

## ⚠️ **CRISIS SUMMARY**

### **CRITICAL FINDING:**
System scan reveals **18 controllers still using ClerkAuthGuard** and **WebSocket service using @clerk/backend** - this means:

- ❌ **100% of core platform features are broken**
- ❌ **Real-time messaging completely offline**
- ❌ **Video therapy sessions cannot authenticate**
- ❌ **Community features non-functional**
- ❌ **Patient-therapist communication blocked**
- ❌ **Mental health services unavailable**

### **BUSINESS IMPACT:**
- **CRISIS LEVEL**: Mental health platform completely offline
- **USER IMPACT**: Vulnerable patients cannot access critical services
- **THERAPIST IMPACT**: Cannot conduct sessions or communicate with patients
- **COMMUNITY IMPACT**: Support groups and peer connections severed

---

## 🎯 **CRISIS RESPONSE PLAN**

### **AGENT REDEPLOYMENT STRATEGY**

**Backend Agent: EMERGENCY ESCALATION**
- **Priority**: CRITICAL - Platform restoration
- **Timeline**: Next 8 hours for core functionality
- **Focus**: WebSocket auth + core controllers
- **Document**: URGENT_BACKEND_ESCALATION.md

**AI/DevOps Agent: ACCELERATED OPPORTUNITY**
- **Priority**: HIGH - Complete independent work
- **Timeline**: Take advantage of backend blockage
- **Focus**: Full content moderation service implementation
- **Document**: AI_DEVOPS_URGENT_UPDATE.md

**Frontend Agent: STANDBY MODE**
- **Priority**: MEDIUM - Await backend stability
- **Timeline**: Begin when backend reaches 60% auth migration
- **Focus**: Preparation and planning phase
- **Status**: Cannot proceed until WebSocket auth is fixed

---

## 📊 **REVISED TIMELINE**

### **CRISIS PHASE (Next 24-48 Hours)**

**Hour 0-2: Emergency Response**
- ✅ Manager: Crisis assessment and agent redeployment complete
- 🔥 Backend: Fix WebSocket authentication (CRITICAL)
- 🚀 AI/DevOps: Begin accelerated Flask service implementation

**Hour 2-4: Core Restoration**
- 🔥 Backend: Migrate 3 core controllers (dashboard, client, messaging)
- 🚀 AI/DevOps: Complete Ollama integration and basic classification

**Hour 4-8: Platform Recovery**
- 🔥 Backend: Migrate community controllers (posts, comments, communities)
- 🚀 AI/DevOps: Dataset processing and model training

**Hour 8-24: Full Restoration**
- 🔥 Backend: Complete all 18 controller migrations
- 🚀 AI/DevOps: Performance optimization and testing
- 🎨 Frontend: Begin JWT migration (when backend stable)

---

## 🔄 **COORDINATION PROTOCOLS**

### **CRISIS COMMUNICATION SCHEDULE**

**Backend Agent Check-ins:**
- **Every 2 hours**: Progress on controller migration
- **Immediate**: Any blocking issues or integration problems
- **Critical**: WebSocket auth must be resolved within 4 hours

**AI/DevOps Agent Updates:**
- **Every 4 hours**: Service implementation progress  
- **Daily**: Complete feature deliverables
- **Integration**: Prepare for backend connection when auth is fixed

**Manager Agent Oversight:**
- **Continuous**: Monitor both crisis response and opportunity exploitation
- **Quality Gates**: Ensure no corners cut during crisis recovery
- **Integration Planning**: Prepare for post-crisis system integration

## 🛡️ **RISK MITIGATION**

### **IDENTIFIED RISKS & RESPONSES**

**Risk: WebSocket Auth Cannot Be Fixed Quickly**
- **Mitigation**: Manager Agent provides direct technical assistance
- **Escalation**: Consider temporary Clerk/JWT hybrid approach
- **Fallback**: Implement basic auth for core features first

**Risk: Controller Migration Breaks Existing Functionality**  
- **Mitigation**: Test each controller individually before proceeding
- **Validation**: Manager Agent reviews each migration for compatibility
- **Rollback**: Maintain ability to revert problematic changes

**Risk: AI Service Development Stalls During Crisis**
- **Mitigation**: AI/DevOps Agent works independently without backend deps
- **Advantage**: Use crisis time to complete full service implementation
- **Preparation**: Have integration ready when backend stabilizes
