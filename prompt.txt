ULTRATHINK and use sequential-thinking-mcp to plan/fix/add the issue below

axios client issues. 
- do a full review on the /lib/api/ folder. 
- first issue is for some reason the frontend is still accessing /auth/login instead of /api/auth/login
- this might be because of the confusing way this was setup in that folder, please refactor it and fix that issue. THE ISSUE IS NOT THE BACKEND. ITS THE FRONT
- i also notice that there are some issues here with types. MOREOEVER, there should be no types in here. it should be moved

use brave-search mcp to look up the internet for implementations, use context7 mcp for latest docs. Commit your changes along the way (DONT CREATE A NEW BRANCH) and the nextjs and nestjs servers are already running (:3001) for nestjs and (:3000) for nextjs. Use Serena for asking questions in the codebase or searching or anything to do with the codebase.

- data flow is >> page > components > hooks > lib/api axios > REST > backend controller
- no business logic in components
- pages should be simplified
- axios auth.ts should be sample axios file
- useLogin is a sample hooks file
- use react query alongside axios api 
- PLEASE READ THE DATABASE FIRST BEFORE DOING ANYTHING
- if you see duplicate code, remove the other one or merge them
