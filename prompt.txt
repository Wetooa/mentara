Session Page error
- for some reason, im getting this error when I try to use the Select component in the session page:

Error: A <Select.Item /> must have a value prop that is not an empty string. This is because the Select value can be set to an empty string to clear the selection and show the placeholder.

components/ui/select.tsx (110:5) @ SelectItem

  108 | }: React.ComponentProps<typeof SelectPrimitive.Item>) {
  109 |   return (
> 110 |     <SelectPrimitive.Item
      |     ^



use brave-search mcp to look up the internet for implementations, use context7 mcp for latest docs. Commit your changes along the way (DONT CREATE A NEW BRANCH) and the nextjs and nestjs servers are already running (:3001) for nestjs and (:3000) for nextjs. Use Serena for asking questions in the codebase or searching or anything to do with the codebase.

- data flow is >> page > components > hooks > lib/api axios > REST > backend controller
- no business logic in components
- pages should be simplified
- axios auth.ts should be sample axios file
- useLogin is a sample hooks file
- use react query alongside axios api 
- PLEASE READ THE DATABASE FIRST BEFORE DOING ANYTHING
- if you see duplicate code, remove the other one or merge them
- DONT RUN THE SEED FILE AGAIN
