ULTRATHINK and use sequential-thinking-mcp to plan/fix/add the issue below

Video Call Feature In Messenger
- implement webrtc for a video call feature in the messenger part
- you dont have to save the data here for now, so dont make tables
- just make sure that two people are able to call each other and see each other
- i would like simplicity here, currently when clicking on it, it redirects the user to a different page. this is fine. 
- when the user calls, the other one should recieve an pop up on the upper right corner of the screen with a button to accept or reject the call


use brave-search mcp to look up the internet for implementations, use context7 mcp for latest docs. Commit your changes along the way (DONT CREATE A NEW BRANCH) and the nextjs and nestjs servers are already running (:3001) for nestjs and (:3000) for nextjs. Use Serena for asking questions in the codebase or searching or anything to do with the codebase.

- data flow is >> page > components > hooks > lib/api axios > REST > backend controller
- no business logic in components
- pages should be simplified
- axios auth.ts should be sample axios file
- useLogin is a sample hooks file
- use react query alongside axios api 
- PLEASE READ THE DATABASE FIRST BEFORE DOING ANYTHING
- if you see duplicate code, remove the other one or merge them
- DONT RUN THE SEED FILE AGAIN
