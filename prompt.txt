Websockets Issue
- we have quite a bit of an issue, see those useRealTime hooks, i think those are deprecated. as far as i konw, the entire messaging system works without using those hooks. if this is true, then delete them since they are depracated
- however, it seemss that the outdated /hooks/notification files still use these hooks. these are outdated as well. the notification hooks should utilize the same logic or system as the already working messaging system.
- if there are real time code that is shared between them then just extract that logic


use brave-search mcp to look up the internet for implementations, use context7 mcp for latest docs. Commit your changes along the way (DONT CREATE A NEW BRANCH) and the nextjs and nestjs servers are already running (:3001) for nestjs and (:3000) for nextjs. Use Serena for asking questions in the codebase or searching or anything to do with the codebase.

- data flow is >> page > components > hooks > lib/api axios > REST > backend controller
- no business logic in components
- pages should be simplified
- axios auth.ts should be sample axios file
- useLogin is a sample hooks file
- use react query alongside axios api 
- PLEASE READ THE DATABASE FIRST BEFORE DOING ANYTHING
- if you see duplicate code, remove the other one or merge them
- DONT RUN THE SEED FILE AGAIN
