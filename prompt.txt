ULTRATHINK and use sequential-thinking-mcp to plan/fix/add the issue below


The Websocket Connection is finally working for the Messaging component
- its time to integrate the notifications component as well
- the notifications stuff is already in place, i think you just have to set it up on the frontend and enable it in the backend. if you get confused, implement it like its done in the messaging component

use brave-search mcp to look up the internet for implementations, use context7 mcp for latest docs. Commit your changes along the way (DONT CREATE A NEW BRANCH) and the nextjs and nestjs servers are already running (:3001) for nestjs and (:3000) for nextjs. Use Serena for asking questions in the codebase or searching or anything to do with the codebase.

- data flow is >> page > components > hooks > lib/api axios > REST > backend controller
- no business logic in components
- pages should be simplified
- axios auth.ts should be sample axios file
- useLogin is a sample hooks file
- use react query alongside axios api 
- PLEASE READ THE DATABASE FIRST BEFORE DOING ANYTHING
- if you see duplicate code, remove the other one or merge them
- DONT RUN THE SEED FILE AGAIN
