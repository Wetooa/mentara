Websockets is not working in the project. The error is as follows:

🔍 [SOCKET] Error details: {}

lib/socket.ts (69:15) @ getSocket/<

  67 |     socket.on('connect_error', (error) => {
  68 |       console.error('🚫 [SOCKET] Main socket connection error:', error);
> 69 |       console.error('🔍 [SOCKET] Error details:', {
     |               ^
  70 |         message: error.message,
  71 |         description: error.description,
  72 |         type: error.type,

im trying to test two different windows to see if the websockets are working, but it seems like the connection is not being established properly.


use brave-search mcp to look up the internet for implementations, use context7 mcp for latest docs. Commit your changes along the way (DONT CREATE A NEW BRANCH) and the nextjs and nestjs servers are already running (:3001) for nestjs and (:3000) for nextjs. Use Serena for asking questions in the codebase or searching or anything to do with the codebase.

- data flow is >> page > components > hooks > lib/api axios > REST > backend controller
- no business logic in components
- pages should be simplified
- axios auth.ts should be sample axios file
- useLogin is a sample hooks file
- use react query alongside axios api 
- PLEASE READ THE DATABASE FIRST BEFORE DOING ANYTHING
- if you see duplicate code, remove the other one or merge them
- DONT RUN THE SEED FILE AGAIN
