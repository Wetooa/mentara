ULTRATHINK and use sequential-thinking-mcp to plan and fix

welcome page issues
- please improve the ui in this portion, search up whats good to use and improve it to best of your abilities
- basically make it "prettier"
- dont forget that this page also recommends communities too
- this is kinda like the landing page for authenticated users which is why i would like good design here


use brave-search mcp to look up the internet for implementations, use context7 mcp for latest docs. Commit your changes along the way (DONT CREATE A NEW BRANCH) and the nextjs and nestjs servers are already running (:3001) for nestjs and (:3000) for nextjs. Use Serena for asking questions in the codebase or searching or anything to do with the codebase.

- data flow is >> page > components > hooks > lib/api axios > REST > backend controller
- no business logic in components
- pages should be simplified
- axios auth.ts should be sample axios file
- useLogin is a sample hooks file
- use react query alongside axios api 
- PLEASE READ THE DATABASE FIRST BEFORE DOING ANYTHING
- if you see duplicate code, remove the other one or merge them
